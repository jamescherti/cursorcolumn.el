![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jamescherti/cursorcolumn.el)

The `cursorcolumn.el` Emacs package visually highlights the current column where the cursor is positioned by drawing a vertical line.

This package is a fork of vline.el and offers improvements in performance and bug fixes, making use of more modern Emacs functions and effectively superseding the vline.el package.

## Features

- **Performance Optimizations**: Improved performance over the original vline.el, ensuring smoother interactions, especially in large buffers.
- **Bug fixes**: Addressed issues in vline.el (such as [#1](https://github.com/buzztaiki/vline/pull/1), which the vline author hasn't merged since Feb. 12, 2024), ensuring smoother interactions, especially in large buffers.
